/**
 * @brief Processor for vertex reconstruction from tracks or particles.
 * @ingroup MarlinRave
 * @author Fabian Moser
 *
 * The RaveVertexing processor provides the Marlin toolchain with the vertex
 * fitting capabilities of the Rave toolkit. It provides various different 
 * algorithms such as:
 *  - Kalman vertex fitter
 *  - Trimmed Kalman vertex fitter
 *  - Adaptive vertex fitter
 *  - Multivertex fitter
 *  - Adaptive vertex reconstructor
 *
 * It allows detailed configuration and tuning of the available algorithms
 * through a flexible string-based interface accessible directly from the 
 * Marlin steering file or GUI.
 *
 * The RaveVertexing processor takes LCIO objects of the types EVENT::Track 
 * or EVENT::ReconstructedParticle as input and produces EVENT::Vertex
 * instances and optionally also new instances of the input objects refitted
 * with the newly gained vertex information.
 *  
 * For instructions on how to use this processor from within the Marlin
 * framework, please refer to the @ref RaveVertexingUsage "main page".
